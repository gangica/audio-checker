# audio-checker

Chrome extension using React, Socket.io and Audio Worklet to detect copyrighted audio recording on browser.

As this is just a demo for my real project at work, I have adjusted to the data submission to the server by replacing actual Socket server and API calls with dummy ones. 
Besides that, the workflow remains the same.
